## Project Title:

NotifyAll

## Project Summary:

The project was to build a fully working web application which aims to provide a solution for the need to send group notifications. This could be for various scenarios, such as class cancellations notice by an instructor or the introduction of a new member in a study group. The application aims to fulfill these requirements in a user-friendly manner.
Motivation:

## Motivation:

The motivation behind this web application comes from the manual process of sending notifications to groups of people. I was inspired by my mother, who runs an academic institution in Korea. Recently, I was told that she had to manually add every email and phone number for announcements every time she sends one. Recognizing that not everyone has a technical background, I aim to create a user-friendly solution for sending out announcements to groups.
Explanation:

## Explaination:

To use the application, the user must sign up and create groups with members. Each member's contact information, an email, must be provided. The user can then send out information by filling out a form that includes a title and some message content. Then selected group will then be broadcasted the message through the AWS SNS service.
